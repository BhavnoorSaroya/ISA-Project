## instructions to run

1. clone the repo
2. cd ISA-project
3. ```npm install``` (the project is currently untested on deno or bun but it should run)
4. ```npm run dev```

## some vscode extensions to consider
* prettier code formatter
* tailwind css intellisense
* Svelte for Vscode
* (optional) Tailwind Fold - personal preference if you think the tailwind classes get a little messy
